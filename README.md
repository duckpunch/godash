[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/duckpunch/godash.svg)][ci]

Data structures and utilities to represent the [game of Go][go].

This library depends on [Immutable.js][immutable] and [lodash][lodash].

## Getting Started

Install `godash` via [npm][npm].

    npm install godash

`require` and use it in your modules.

```javascript
var godash = require('godash');
var board = new godash.Board(19);
var tengen = new godash.Coordinate(9, 9); // 0-based

board.moves.has(tengen); // false

var standardOpening = placeStone(
    board,
    tengen,
    godash.BLACK
);
standardOpening.moves.has(tengen); // true
```

## Why Godash?

Godash provides the "primitives" for Go necessary for creating UIs that go
beyond a simple SGF player.  You can create whatever UI you want without having
to reinvent the wheel every time.

Check out the [documentation][godash-docs] to see what Godash provides.

## Roadmap

Godash doesn't currently do very much parameter checking.  It'd probably be
nice to add that.

There also isn't much support for writing SGFs.  This, too, might be added in
the future.  Further, reading SGFs is a bit brittle at the moment since the
full SGF spec is not implemented.
